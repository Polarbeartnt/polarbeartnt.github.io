Biography
======
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University. My research lies at the intersection of quantum optics and its practical applications. In previous years, I have mastered the construction of optical experiment systems, including single-pixel imaging, digital holographic imaging, and photon entanglement. Besides, computer techniques play an important role in my study. I have learnt the preparation and use of machine learning programs from summer school project, which has been applied in my research work. And I engage in the construction and maintenance of laboratory computing servers in our research group.

In 2022, we were dedicated to the implementation of the Doppler effect and single-pixel imaging, handling the velocity detection of the axial moving targets in the field of view. I independently completed part of the research work as my undergraduate graduation project (See [[link](/publications/velocity)]) and collaborated for another part.

In 2021, we first realized the concurrent imaging, location, and classification in a single-pixel imaging system, using the deep learning method (See [[link](/publications/sp-ilc)]). As one of the co-first authors, I have completed the entire work on neural network programming, testing and training, and most of work on optical system construction. The repository is available on GitHub [[link](https://github.com/Polarbeartnt/SP-ILC)].

In 2020, I used to complete a digital holographic imaging system, which realized the holography recording and reconstruction using both optical and digital methods, and use the self-designed differential operators to improve imaging quality (See [[link](/talks/holo)]). 

Recently, I am attempting to set up the photon entanglement and coincidence counting experiment.
