I have completed a digital holographic imaging system, which realized the holography recording and reconstruction using both optical and digital methods. Then, differential operators and filters (including Laplace operator, Sobel Operator, High Pass Filter, and two self-designed method) were used to improve the imaging quality. 


Some of the instrument and results are listed below:
